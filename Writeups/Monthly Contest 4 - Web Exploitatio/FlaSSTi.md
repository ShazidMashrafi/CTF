## Vulnerability & Exploitation
The challenge presented a simple input field with "Your wish:" prompt. The name "FlaSSTi" hinted at a Flask Server-Side Template Injection vulnerability.

### Discovery
I started by testing basic template expressions:
- `7 * 7` - To check if expressions are evaluated
- `{{ config }}` - To confirm the SSTI vulnerability exists by displaying Flask configuration

### Exploitation
After confirming the vulnerability, I needed to access system functions to read the flag file. The successful payload was:

```
{{ config.__class__.__init__.__globals__['os'].popen('cat /app/flag.txt').read() }}
```

This payload works by:
1. Starting from the Flask `config` object
2. Accessing its class's initialization method's global namespace
3. Retrieving the `os` module from globals
4. Using `popen()` to execute a shell command to read the flag file

This demonstrates how dangerous template injection can be, allowing attackers to access the filesystem and execute commands through template rendering.

## Flag
The flag for this challenge is: `JKKNIUCTF{Fl4SK_SS7!_eXpL0i73D!}`
