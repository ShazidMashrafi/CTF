## Analysis & Exploitation
From the source code review, I discovered:
- The application used cookies to determine user roles (guest vs admin)
- Guest credentials (`guest:guest`) were found in a CSS comment
- The `/admin` route only checked if the `role` cookie value was "admin"

Exploitation was simple:
1. Logged in with `guest:guest` credentials
2. Modified the `role` cookie value from "guest" to "admin" using browser dev tools
3. Accessed the `/admin` page which now displayed the flag

## Vulnerability
The application had a broken access control vulnerability, trusting client-side cookies for authorization without server-side verification.

## Flag
The flag is: `JKKNIUCTF{C00k13_m4n1PUL@73d!_5Ucc355FULLY}`
