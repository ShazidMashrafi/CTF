# Image Gallery-2 Challenge Writeup

## Challenge Information
- **Name**: Image Gallery-2
- **Points**: 100
- **Description**: I heard there's a secret admin panel in this webpage. The developer is pretty confident that only admins can access it. Is it True? 
- **Link**: Same as Image Gallery-1 (http://139.162.54.146:5000/)
- **Difficulty**: Easy
- **Flag Format**: JKKNIUCTF{s0m3_t3xt}

## Initial Analysis
The challenge revealed the existence of an admin panel on the same website. I accessed it directly at:
```
http://139.162.54.146:5000/admin
```
This presented a login form requiring authentication credentials.

## Exploitation
Since the challenge hinted at bypassing admin protection, I attempted SQL injection on the login form. In a vulnerable application, the server might execute a query like:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'input_username' AND password = 'input_password'
```

I used a classic authentication bypass payload in the username field:
```
admin' OR '1'='1
```

When inserted into the SQL query, the condition `'1'='1'` (which is always true) bypassed the authentication check. The server granted access to the admin panel, revealing the flag.

## Flag
The flag for this challenge is: `JKKNIUCTF{SQL_injetion_huh?}`
