## Vulnerability & Exploitation
The challenge presented a "Vault Locker" requiring a passcode that was checked against an MD5 hash using PHP's loose comparison (`==`).

PHP treats strings starting with "0e" followed by digits as scientific notation in loose comparisons. For example, `"0e123" == "0e456"` evaluates to `true` because both are interpreted as 0.

Several known strings produce MD5 hashes in this "0e[digits]" format:
- `QNKCDZO` â†’ `0e830400451993494058024219903391`

By entering `QNKCDZO` as the passcode, the server compared its MD5 hash (which starts with 0e) with the expected hash (also starting with 0e) using `==`. Due to type juggling, both were treated as 0, making the comparison succeed.
