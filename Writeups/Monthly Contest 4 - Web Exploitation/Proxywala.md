# Proxywala Challenge Writeup

## Challenge Information
- **Name**: Proxywala
- **Points**: 200
- **Description**: Fahim bhai said this one is also an easy challenge. Is it? Or what do you think?
- **Link**: http://139.162.54.146:5002/
- **Hint**: According to him, a common Linux system variable needs to be checked by users, as it might reveal the destination.

## Vulnerability
The challenge featured a proxy service vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The application likely implemented filters to block direct access to local files, but these could be bypassed.

## Exploitation
My approach was two-fold:

1. First, I bypassed IP filtering using the decimal representation of localhost:
```
file://2130706433/secret/fl../ag.html
```
This revealed a page with a placeholder flag.

2. Based on the hint about "Linux system variable," I accessed the process environment variables:
```
file://2130706433/proc/self/environ
```
This file contains all environment variables for the running process. By scrolling horizontally through the output, I found the flag that had been stored as an environment variable.

## Key Concepts
- SSRF vulnerability exploitation
- Decimal IP representation bypass (2130706433 = 127.0.0.1)
- Accessing sensitive system files via `/proc/self/environ`
- Insecure storage of secrets in environment variables
