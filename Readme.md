# CTF Challenge Writeups

## About Me
I'm Shazid Mashrafi, a student majoring in Computer Science and Engineering who tackles CTF challenges for fun and learning. I'm not a dedicated CTF player, but I enjoy these challenges to improve my understanding of web security.

## Purpose
This repository serves as a way to document and share my CTF journey. By storing my writeups here, I can:
- Track my progress and learning over time
- Share my solutions with others interested in CTF challenges
- Contribute to the CTF community by explaining my approaches

## Why I Do CTFs
As a computer science student, understanding security vulnerabilities helps me prepare for my future career. By solving these challenges, I learn to:
- Identify common security flaws
- Write more secure code
- Think from an attacker's perspective

## This Repository
This collection contains writeups for web exploitation challenges I've solved. Each writeup documents my approach, the vulnerabilities involved, and lessons learned.

I focus primarily on web exploitation because it directly relates to my interests in web development and application security.
